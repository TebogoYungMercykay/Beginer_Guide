Markdown is a light markup language often used for READMEs (though you'll find other use cases for it, too!).
It is fairly straightforward, and much of the syntax is intuitive.

- To make text bold, surround it with double asterisks. So this code:
    **wonderful**

- To italicize text, surround it with underscores. So this code:
    _Did I turn off the stove?_

- Surround text in backticks (`, not a single quote):
    `strong`

- The Title Sequence
    Headings are even simpler! For h1 through h6 tags, all you'll need is a # before your text.
    The number of #s you include tells Markdown which header tag you're using


NB:= Much like how your HTML files should be saved with a .html extension,
     your Markdown files should be saved with a .md extension.
