1. Fetch the recent remote repository history
    $ git fetch upstream
    
2. Merge the upstream master branch into your master branch (Make certain you are in the master branch)
    $ git checkout master
    $ git merge upstream/master
    
3. Git pull : Pull = Fetch + Merge
    $ git pull upstream
    
4. Git push : Sending Your Commits to Remote Repositories
    - git add .
    - git commit -m "Commit message"
    $ git push upstream master
    
5. github pull requests
    One protocol for updating repositories that we use at Software Carpentry is the "pull request."
    This is a bundle of updates to the repository that can be accepted and merged into the upstream repository or rejected and not merged.
    If you would like to share your changes with the upstream repository, click the green "compare and review" button, and github will show you a summary of your commits.
    If you then click on "Click to create a pull request for this comparison," your request will be sent to the upstream repository for acceptance or rejection.
    
6. git resolve : Resolving Conflicts
    # to be updated.
